FreeForAll
==========

A project from high school which was to create a game. 
This was done in about 3 months, and there are bugs to be expected as we tried to finish up on our last days of high school.

This project will NOT be updated as I no longer have access to the software which was used to create this game. This was created using Torque 2D in Torque Script, a subscript of C#.

Programming was done by Brandon Altarejos.
Graphic Designers were Jerzy, and Andrea
